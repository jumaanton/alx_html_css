Create the most basic, simple and valid HTML file called base_index.html

The page should contain:

* a DOCTYPE
* a head: 
    with a title
* a body
Tips: don’t forget to read all concept pages…

Test the webpage with the official HTML Validator. You will see that it is not happy!

First things first, fix the code in index.html so that it is valid.

You will see that the validator then becomes much happier!


## 1. Make a cool first webpage

Copy your file base_index.html to index.html

Add in the body of the page:

* at least 4 paragraphs;
* headings (titles) of level 1, 2 and 3, which are represented by 
a clickable image of your choice (you can use the https://www.holbertonschool.com/holberton-logo.png image, or another one you find on the internet by using its full URL); and it may link to any URL online that you want.

## 2. Make a cool other webpage
mandatory
Copy your file base_index.html to tweets.html

Add in the body of the page:

* embed at least one tweet (Here’s the official documentation from Twitter about embedding single tweets in a webpage’s HTML code.)
* contain a link to your index.html webpage, for users who may go back to your homepage
In index.html, add a link to tweets.html, for users landing on your homepage, who want to see your tweets!
